## How It Looks Now
This is how the Angular web application looks when viewing your timetable

![New Timetable](_images/its_timetable.png?raw=true "New Timetable")

## How It Used To Look
This is the current timetable used by ITSligo - Fairly outdated looking and not very user-friendly

![Old Timetable](_images/oldtimetable.png?raw=true "Old Timetable")

## Extra Module Info (Expanded)

![Module Info](_images/its_timetable2.png?raw=true "Module Info")

## Hiding Modules

![Hiding Modules](_images/its_timetable3.png?raw=true "Hiding Modules")
