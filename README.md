# Timetables

## How It Looks Now
This is how the Angular web application looks when viewing your timetable

![New Timetable](_images/newtimetable.png?raw=true "New Timetable")

## How It Used To Look
This is the current timetable used by ITSligo - Fairly outdated looking and not very user-friendly

![Old Timetable](_images/oldtimetable.png?raw=true "Old Timetable")

## Architecture
The layout for the whole service

![Architecture Diagram](_images/architecture.png?raw=true "Architecture Diagram")
